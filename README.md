# 🛡️ Home Cybersecurity Lab

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my personal cybersecurity home lab. This environment is where I simulate real world enterprise security scenarios and build hands on experience across blue team operations, GRC, IAM, and vulnerability management.

As an Information Security student graduating in December 2025, I use this lab to strengthen practical skills, document projects, and demonstrate initiative beyond the classroom.

## 🎯 Purpose
This lab is designed to prepare me for roles in:
• SOC Analysis  
• Governance Risk and Compliance  
• Identity and Access Management  
• Security Operations  

Each project focuses on real security workflows that organizations rely on daily.

## 🧪 Lab Environment

### 💻 Hardware
Dell OptiPlex 7050 SFF used as the primary lab machine

### 🖥️ Virtualization
VirtualBox running multiple isolated systems for testing and simulation

### 🗂️ Operating Systems
Windows 10 virtual machines  
Linux virtual machines  

## 🛠️ Core Security Tools
Security Onion for threat detection and monitoring  
Elastic Stack for SIEM analysis and log investigation  
Tenable for vulnerability scanning and assessments  
PowerShell for automation and remediation  
Active Directory for identity and access testing  
pfSense for network segmentation and traffic visibility
