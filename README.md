# Home Cybersecurity Lab

## Overview
This repository documents my personal home cybersecurity lab where I practice real world defensive security skills. The goal of this lab is to simulate enterprise environments, strengthen blue team knowledge, and build hands on experience in security operations, incident response, vulnerability management, and governance risk and compliance.

I use this environment to reinforce concepts learned in school, certifications, and internships while creating projects that demonstrate practical security capabilities.

## Objectives
1. Build real world defensive security experience
2. Practice SOC analyst workflows and alert triage
3. Simulate attack scenarios and document incident response
4. Perform vulnerability scanning and remediation
5. Strengthen IAM and access auditing knowledge
6. Develop GRC documentation aligned with security frameworks

## Lab Environment

### Hardware
Dell OptiPlex 7050 SFF used as the primary lab machine

### Virtualization
VirtualBox for running multiple isolated environments

### Operating Systems
Windows 10 virtual machines
Linux virtual machines

## Core Security Tools
Security Onion for threat monitoring and detection
Elastic Stack for log analysis and SIEM workflows
Tenable for vulnerability scanning and assessment
PowerShell for automation and remediation
Active Directory for identity and access testing
pfSense for network segmentation and traffic control

## Projects Included

### Security Operations and Threat Monitoring
Simulated SOC environment using log ingestion and alert triage  
IOC analysis and documentation of findings  
Creation of basic response playbooks  

### Simulated Ransomware Incident Response
Detection of suspicious activity through SIEM alerts  
Investigation of attack indicators  
Full incident report documenting timeline and containment steps  

### Vulnerability Management
Scanning Windows and Linux systems for misconfigurations  
Prioritizing risks based on severity  
Applying fixes using PowerShell and system hardening techniques  

### GRC and Access Auditing
Reviewing Active Directory privileges and access rights  
Documenting risks aligned to NIST and ISO principles  
Building basic policy and compliance documentation  

## Skills Developed
Security monitoring and alert triage  
Incident response investigation  
Vulnerability analysis and remediation  
Risk identification and documentation  
Identity and access auditing  
Security documentation and reporting  

## Purpose
This lab serves as a hands on learning platform to prepare for roles in SOC analysis, GRC, IAM, and security operations. Each project focuses on real scenarios that security teams deal with daily.
